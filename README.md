# Dog-Classifier-App-Model
This is the notebook I created based on some of the code from Udacity's [dog project](https://github.com/udacity/dog-project). You can go there for the dog image dataset and the bottleneck features I used for the InceptionV3 network. This model is seen used in my [Dog Classifier App](https://github.com/brandons209/Dog-Classifier-App).
